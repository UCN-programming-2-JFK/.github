Author: [Jakob Farian Krarup](mailto:jfk@ucn.dk) ðŸ˜Š

> This repository contains exercises, stubs and solutions for understanding 
> coding against databases, data structures, software design patterns and algorithms.
> It also contains code samples relating to [Java game programming](https://github.com/UCN-programming-2-JFK/JavaGameProgrammingCodesamples/tree/master), in case you would like to start a side project to elevate your coding skills.

## Part 1 - Databases

### Sample project for working with databases using the DAO pattern (Data Access Objects)
[Sample DAO architecture project](https://github.com/UCN-programming-2-JFK/SampleDaoArchitectureProject)


##  Part 2 - Data structures and algorithms

### Recursion exercise
[Recursive folder size calculator](https://github.com/UCN-programming-2-JFK/RecursiveFolderSizeCalculator)
- this project recursively finds the size of a folder including all subfolders and files
